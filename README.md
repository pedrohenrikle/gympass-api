# **GympassAPI**

‚ú® A copy (or something like) of the Gympass API. Node.js & Typescript based, developed with concepts like SOLID, DDD, TDD, Repository Pattern, Factory Method and RBAC system. Has unit test for especific use-cases and test E2E for every HTTP controller. ‚ú®

## Why GympassAPI?

GympassAPI was a project to better learn the concepts involved in the backend, such as SOLID concepts, the principles of DDD and TDD. I also learned about the RBAC authorization system, the use of the JWT token, authentication and validation systems and much more.


## Getting Started

To get started with GympassAPI, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Installation

First of all, clone the repository and install de dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

### 2. Setting up your environment

Now we must setup our environment variables. Create a file on root as ***.env***. Inside, put all data like is on .env.example

```shell
NODE_ENV=dev

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_HERE

# Database
DATABASE_URL="url_from_your_database"
```

### 3. Create a Database

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file inside the project, so if you want to create the container as I thot, you can run the following command

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

and if you want to stop the container

```shell
docker compose stop
```

## üõë Endpoints

Here you can see all the endpoints of the application

### Users

- ```POST - '/users'```
  - This is the user's entry route, where the user will register with on the application. You must send the request with a ***data*** equal a some user's informations on the body of the requisition.
  <br><br>

    | Params       | Type        | Default    |
    | :---         | :---        | :---       |
    | `name`       | **string**  | -          |
    | `email`      | **string**  | -          |
    | `password`   | **string**  | -          |
    | `role`       | **string**  | `'MEMBER'` |


<br><br>

- `POST - '/sessions'`
  - This is the authenticate route. Here, the user can log-in on our application. Send this data as the body of the request as a JSON. After that, we will generate a access token that contains the **user ID** and about his **role**.
  <br><br>

    | Params       | Type       | Default  |
    | :---         | :---       | :---     |
    | `email`      | **string** | -        |
    | `password`   | **string** | -        |

<br><br>

- ```PATCH - '/token/refresh'```
  - This the route where, if you have a refresh token, we will generate another JWT Token.
  <br><br>

<br><br>

- ```GET - '/me'```
  - This route requires that you already be logged-in. Here, you send your requisition with a JWT Token as authorization.
  <br><br>

    | Header           | Type       | 
    | :---             | :---       | 
    | `Authorization`  | **Bearer** |

  will be something like this

  ```ts
  fetch(url, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json' 
    }
  })
  ```

### Gyms

On ***Gyms***, every route needs to be authenticated, that means every request must have the following header: `Authorization Bearer ${token}`. Some routes also require `role = 'ADMIN'`.

- ```GET - '/gyms/search'```
  - Here you can search gyms by their name. You must send the request with a ***query*** as **q** on the body of the requisition as a JSON.
  <br><br>

    | Params       | Type       | Default  |
    | :---         | :---       | :---     |
    | `q`          | **string** | -        |
    | `page`       | **number** | 1        |

<br><br>

- ```GET - '/gyms/nearby'```
  - Here you can find nearby gyms based on latitude and longitude of the user. You must send the request with a ***latitude*** and ***longitude*** of the user on the body of the requisitionas as a JSON.

    | Params         | Type       | Default  |
    | :---           | :---       | :---     |
    | `latitude`     | **number** | -        |
    | `longitude`    | **number** | -        |

<br><br>

- ```POST - '/gyms'```
  - Here we create a new Gym on database. You must do this as a `'ADMIN'` user so your access token must have this proprerty. You can pass the informations of the gym on the body of the requisition as a JSON.

    | Params         | Type       | Default  |
    | :---           | :---       | :---     |
    | `title`        | **string** | -        |
    | `description`  | **string** | -        |
    | `phone`        | **number** | -        |

    | `longitude`    | **number** | -        |

### Check Ins

On ***Check Ins***, every route needs to be authenticated.

- ```GET - '/check-ins/history'```
  - Here we can take the history of all check-ins that the user made it. You must just provide your JWT Token for the authorization.

    | Header           | Type       | 
    | :---             | :---       | 
    | `Authorization`  | **Bearer** |

    fetch(url, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json' 
      }
    })
    ```
<br><br>

- ```GET - '/check-ins/metrics'```
  - Here we can take the metrics of the user. You must just provide your JWT Token for the authorization.

    | Header           | Type       | 
    | :---             | :---       |

  will be something like this

  ```ts
  fetch(url, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json' 
    }
  })
  ```

<br><br>

- ```POST - '/gyms/:gymId/check-ins'```
  - Here we can create a check-in on a gym. You must provide on the URL param the id of the gym as **gymID** and on the body of the request the **latitude** and **longitude** of the user as a JSON

    | Params         | Type       | Default  |
    | :---           | :---       | :---     |
    | `gymId`        | **string** | -        |
    | `latitude`     | **number** | -        |
    | `longitude`    | **number** | -        |

<br><br>

- ```POST - '/check-ins/:checkInId/validate'```
  - Here we validate the check-in of the user. You must do this as a `'ADMIN'` user so your access token must have this proprerty. You also must provide on the URL param the **checkInId** as the check-in that will be validated.

    | Params         | Type       | Default  |
    | :---           | :---       | :---     |
